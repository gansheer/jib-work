= Camel-k JIB

:sectnums:
:sectnumlevels: 2

== Goal

The goal of this work is to test the jib maven plugins available in the context of camel-k's building of the integration kit container images.

What is expected from the plugin is:

* to be able to build a container image containing the content from the /tmp/kit-xxxxxx-yyyyy/context instead of the default target folder
* to be able to build incrementally the container images between multiple integration kits by having some influence on layer build
* to be able to build the container image for different architectures (linux/am64, linux/arm64, etc)

The Camel-k build with Spectrum publish strategy is used a comparative source for expected result.
